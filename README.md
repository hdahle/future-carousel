Learning about React Native, Expo, and a Carousel UI

The Futureplanet covid-charts are displayed in an Android/iOS app.

## What

The UI is based on Carousel and FlatList:
- Swipe left-right for world regions (Asia, Africa, Europe, ...)
- Scroll up-down for countries within the region

## Expo

The app uses expo.io and the Expo Go client

## Assets

The charts (one chart per country) are the same charts that are generated daily based on Johns Hopkins date, i.e. the charts that I auto-generate for the Telegram Bot project.

The app assumes the charts are available from https://hdahle.github.io/telegrambot/img
